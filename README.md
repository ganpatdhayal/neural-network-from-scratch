# Neural Network from Scratch in Python

This repository contains a minimal, from-scratch implementation of a basic feedforward neural network using Python and NumPy. It is designed for educational purposes — to deeply understand how neural networks work under the hood without using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
